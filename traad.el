;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Description:
;;
;; traad is a JSON+HTTP server built around the rope refactoring library. This
;; file provides an API for talking to that server - and thus to rope - from
;; emacs lisp. Or, put another way, it's another way to use rope from emacs.
;;
;; For more details, see the project page at
;; https://github.com/abingham/traad.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Copy traad.el to some location in your emacs load path. Then add
;; "(require 'traad)" to your emacs initialization (.emacs,
;; init.el, or something).
;;
;; Example config:
;;
;;   (require 'traad)

(defun* traad-rename (new-name &key (docstrings t) (in-hierarchy t))
  "Rename the object at the current location.

Attempts to rename all occurrences of the object in the project.

Optional arguments `DOCSTRINGS' and `IN-HIERARCHY' set renaming
options:

  - `DOCSTRINGS' (default `t') specifies whether occurrences in
    comments/docstrings should be renamed. For example, let's say
    we're renaming a variable, `var_to_rename` and `DOCSTRINGS'
    is set to `nil':

    | var_to_rename = 'this is a string'                 # [1]
    |
    | some_variable = var_to_rename                      # [2]
    |
    | # This is an occurrence of `var-to-rename`         # [3]
    |
    | def some_function(input_var):
    |     '''Docstring that has `var_to_rename` in it.'''# [4]
    |     return input_var ** 2
    |
    | some_function(var_to_rename)                       # [5]

    Renaming `var_to_rename` to `new_var_name`, this would
    become:

    | new_var_name = 'this is a string'                  # [1]
    |
    | some_variable = new_var_name                       # [2]
    |
    | # This is an occurrence of `var-to-rename`         # [3]
    |
    | def some_function(input_var):
    |     '''Docstring that has `var_to_rename` in it.'''# [4]
    |     return input_var ** 2
    |
    | some_function(new_var_name)                        # [5]

    Note that [1], [2] & [5] were renamed, but [3] &
    [4] (occurrences in a comment and a docstring) were not
    renamed. If `DOCSTRINGS' were `t', [3] & [4] would have been
    renamed.

  - `IN-HIERARCHY' (default `t') specifies whether occurrences
    higher and lower in the hierarchy should be renamed. (In
    practise this means the same method in a subclass or
    superclass) For example, let's say you're renaming some
    method, `method_to_rename`, and `IN-HIERARCHY' is set to
    `nil':

    | class BaseClass(object):
    |     def method_to_rename():                        # [1]
    |         print('This is the super class.')
    |
    | class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    |     def method_to_rename():                        # [2]
    |         print('This is the derived class.')

    Renaming `BaseClass.method_to_rename` to
    `BaseClass.new_name`, results in:

    | class BaseClass(object):
    |     def new_name():                                # [1]
    |         print('This is the super class.')
    |
    | class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    |     def method_to_rename():                        # [2]
    |         print('This is the derived class.')

    The original method, [1], is renamed. Note that the override
    method in the subclass, [2], does not get renamed. If
    `IN-HIERARCHY' were set to `t', [2] would also be renamed.

Note that unsure occurrences will not be renamed. Rope may find
occurrences that it is unsure about, which are marked as
`unsure`. These will generally be wrong, so you don't want to
include them all. However, this means you may miss some
occurrences of the object. See the Rope documentation for more
details on the `unsure` parameter.

  "Normalize the arguments for the method at point.

This refactors all calls to this function to ensure the variables
are called in the correct order. It also removes explicit
references to keyword arguments whenever possible, replacing them
with positional references. For example, given the following:

    | def this_is_a_test(a, b, c=5):
    |     return [a, b, c]
    |
    | this_is_a_test(a=10, b=10, c=20)
    | this_is_a_test(20, 20, c=10)
    | this_is_a_test('a', 'b', 'c')
    | this_is_a_test(b='b', c='c', a='a')
    | this_is_a_test(a='a', b='b')

Calling `traad-normalize-arguments' on `this_is_a_test`, it would
become:

    | def this_is_a_test(a, b, c=5):
    |     return [a, b, c]
    |
    | this_is_a_test(10, 10, 20)
    | this_is_a_test(20, 20, 10)
    | this_is_a_test('a', 'b', 'c')
    | this_is_a_test('a', 'b', 'c')
    | this_is_a_test('a', 'b')

Note that the arguments in [1] were reordered. A more complex
case would be:

    | def longer_function(a, b, c=10, d=20):
    |     return [a, b, c, d]
    |
    | longer_function(a='a', b='b', d='d')

Calling `traad-normalize-arguments' on `longer_function`, it
would become:

    | def longer_function(a, b, c=10, d=20):
    |     return [a, b, c, d]
    |
    | longer_function('a', 'b', d='d')

It cannot remove the keyword reference to `d`, so \"d='d'\" is
retained.

Calling `traad-remove-argument' on `some_function` with an
`INDEX' of 2, this would become:

    | def some_function(arg1, arg2, arg4='some string'):
    |     '''Do something to some arbitrary parameters.'''

It has removed the third argument, `arg3`.

Note:

  - The index counts from zero, so an index of 0 means the first
    argument and an index of 2 means the _third_ argument.

  - It does not remove internal references to the argument (e.g.
    [1]) in the function logic.

  - References to the function also have their function call
    normalised. See [2], where the explicit keyword reference was
    removed in favour of a positional reference. See

  "Add a new argument at `INDEX' in the signature at point.

Takes the following arguments:

  `INDEX'   - The index to add the argument at. Note that this
              is zero-indexed, so an index of 1 will insert it
              as the _second_ argument.
  `NAME'    - The name of the argument.
  `DEFAULT' - The default value of the argument.
  `VALUE'   - The value to insert for this argument in any
              existing calls to this function.

For example, let's say we have the following:

    | def some_function(arg1, arg2, arg3=10, arg4='some string'):
    |     return [arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4]
    |
    | some_function(1, 2, arg3=3, arg4='four')

Let's call `traad-add-argument' on some_function. We'll supply
the following arguments:

`INDEX'   = 3
`NAME'    = \"new_arg\"
`DEFAULT' = 30
`VALUE'   = 50

This will become:

    | def some_function(arg1, arg2, arg3=10, new_arg=30, arg4='some string'):

    |
    | some_function(1, 2, 3, 50, 'four')                 # [1]

Note that references to the function also have their function
call normalised. See [1], where the explicit keyword reference
was removed in favour of a positional reference. See
`traad-normalize-arguments' for more information.

Arguments are always added as keyword arguments. Rope does not
discriminate based on position, so you can add keyword arguments
out-of-order. For example, back to the original function:

    | def some_function(arg1, arg2, arg3=10, arg4='some string'):
    |     return [arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4]
    |
    | some_function(1, 2, arg3=3, arg4='four')

Adding the same argument as before at `INDEX' = 1, this will
become:

    | def some_function(arg1, new_arg=30, arg2, arg3=10, arg4='some string'):# [1]
    |     return [arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4]
    |
    | some_function(1, 50, 2, 3, 'four')

Watch line [1]. Note that the sequence argument `arg2` now
appears after `new_arg`, a keyword argument, so the function
signature is no longer valid.

(defun traad-inline ()
  "Inline this object (replace the object with the thing it represents.)

Inlining can be performed on many objects.

Functions:

  Inlining a function replaces calls to a function with the
  explicit code the function executes. For example:

    | def do_something():
    |     print sys.version
    |     return C()

  Inlining `do_something`, becomes:

    | print sys.version
    | return C()

  Methods, etc. can also be inlined. For example:

    | class C(object):
    |     var = 1
    |
    |     def f(self, p):                                # [1]
    |         result = self.var + pn                     # [1]
    |         return result                              # [1]
    |
    | c = C()
    | x = c.f(1)                                         # [2]

  Inlining `C.f`, becomes:

    | class C(object):
    |     var = 1
    |
    | c = C()
    | result = c.var + pn                                # [2]
    | x = result                                         # [2]

Parameters:

  Inlning a parameter passes the default value of a keyword
  parameter whenever the parameter is not explicitly referenced.
  For example:

    | def f(p1=1, p2=2):
    |     pass
    |
    | f(3, 2)
    | f()                                                # [1]
    | f(3)                                               # [2]
    | f(p1=5, p2=7)                                      # [3]

  Inlining `p2`, becomes:

    | def f(p1=1, p2=2):
    |     pass
    |
    | f(3, 2)
    | f(p2=2)                                            # [1]
    | f(3, 2)                                            # [2]
    | f(5, 7)                                            # [3]

[1] and [2] have had explicit calls to the keyword argument
added. Note that:

  - It prefers positional over keyword calls.

  - It also normalizes the arguments, so [3] is affected. See
    `traad-normalize-arguments' for more information.

    | similar_var = 1 * 2 * 3                            # [1]

And we extract the following:

    | my_var = ${region_start}1 * 2 * 3${region_end} * 4
    | similar_var = 1 * 2 * 3                            # [1]

Extracting to `another_var` gives:

    | another_var = 1 * 2 * 3
    | my_var = another_var * 4
    | similar_var = 1 * 2 * 3                            # [1]

The expression at [1] will not be replaced with a reference to the
new variable.

This replaces 'import *' with explicit references to the objects

For example, let's say we have two files, 'mod1.py' and
'mod2.py'. They look as follows:

    mod1.py:
    | def some_function():
